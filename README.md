## 1. Evolution of Transformers

The Transformer architecture was first introduced in the 2017 paper *"Attention Is All You Need"* by Google, revolutionizing sequence modeling through self-attention mechanisms. Subsequent models like BERT and GPT series dominated NLP tasks. Post-2020, Vision Transformer (ViT) extended its application to computer vision, while Whisper and CLIP explored speech and multimodal domains. Today, Transformers underpin generative AI, LLMs, and cross-modal systems, demonstrating unparalleled scalability and parallelization capabilities.

## 2. Project Objectives

This project aims to:

1. **Combine Theory & Practice**: Reimplement core modules from scratch to demystify mathematical foundations.
2. **Explore New Frontiers**: Investigate applications in non-NLP domains (images, audio, multimodal).
3. **Open Education**: Provide reproducible code, datasets, and tuning guidelines for learners.

## 3. Research Roadmap

### Phase 1: Baseline Validation

* **1.1** Train a Transformer (using Tensorflow/PyTorch) on arithmetic problems (e.g., `a + b * c`) to validate basic reasoning capability.
* **1.2** Visualize attention patterns with tools like TensorBoard.

### Phase 2: Low-level Reimplementation

* **2.1** Rebuild Transformer (Multi-Head Attention, Positional Encoding, etc.) using only NumPy.
* **2.2** Benchmark against mainstream frameworks.

### Phase 3: Module Analysis

* **3.1** Ablate components (e.g., encoder/decoder layers, attention heads), analyze parameters, and design fine-tuning strategies.
* **3.2** Explore lightweight techniques (e.g., knowledge distillation, parameter sharing).

### Phase 4: Cross-domain Applications

* **4.1 Vision**: Reproduce ViT by patchifying images into sequences for classification.
* **4.2 Speech**: Implement Whisper-style speech recognition pipeline.
* **4.3 Multimodal**: Build image-text alignment datasets for CLIP-style cross-modal learning.
